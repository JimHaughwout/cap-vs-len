# cap-vs-len
Exploring cap vs. len in golang to learn more myself. Inspired by this [excellent post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41668053/cap-vs-len-of-slice-in-golang) in Stack Overflow.

What is most interesting to me is to see how capacity allocations change on my machine vs. that in the SO post.
